  ConfigCat Feature Flag Sync
summary: Scans the source code for feature flags and uploads the references to the ConfigCat Dashboard
description: |-
  This Step helps you get rid of technical debt by scanning the source code and highlighting the feature flag usages for each feature flag on the [ConfigCat Dashboard](https://app.configcat.com/).

  [ConfigCat](https://configcat.com/) is a hosted service for feature flag and configuration management. It enables you to decouple feature releases from code deployments. 

  ## Configuring the Step

  1. Log in to [ConfigCat](https://app.configcat.com/)
  1. Create new [ConfigCat Public Management API credentials](https://app.configcat.com/my-account/public-api-credentials/) 
  1. Store your credentials in the following Bitrise secret environment variables: `CONFIGCAT_API_USER`, `CONFIGCAT_API_PASS`.
  1. Add your [ConfigCat config ID](https://configcat.com/docs/advanced/code-references/overview#config-id) to the `ConfigCat Config ID` input variable of this step (`configcat_config_id` in bitrise.yml). The config ID tells the step which feature flags it should search for in your source code.

  For more information about code reference scanning, see the [documentation](https://configcat.com/docs/advanced/code-references/overview/).
